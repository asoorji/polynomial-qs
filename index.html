"question": "What is the degree of the polynomial 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 4?",
"options": ["4", "3", "2", "1"],
"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. In this case, the degree is 4, since the highest power of x is 4."

"question": "Which of the following is not a polynomial: a) 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x + 7, b) 3x^2 + 2x - 1, c) (x-1)/(x+2), d) x^4 + 2x^2 - 1?",
"options": ["c", "a", "b", "d"],
"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "A polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of variables and coefficients, where the variables are raised to non-negative integer powers. Option (c) is not a polynomial, since it has a variable in the denominator."

"options": ["8", "9", "10", "11"],
"answerIndex": 2,
"explanation": "The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is obtained by substituting x=1 in the polynomial. Doing so for the given polynomial, we get 2(1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 4(1) + 7 = 8. Therefore, the correct option is 10."

"options": ["-2, -3", "2, 3", "-1, -6", "1, 6"],
"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "The given equation can be factored as (x+2)(x+3) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are x=-2 and x=-3. Therefore, the correct option is -2, -3."

"question": "What is the remainder when the polynomial 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 1 is divided by (x-1)?",
"options": ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
"answerIndex": 3,
"explanation": "Using polynomial long division or synthetic division, we can divide the given polynomial by (x-1) to get a quotient of 2x^2 + 7x + 4 and a remainder of 3. Therefore, the correct option is 3."
